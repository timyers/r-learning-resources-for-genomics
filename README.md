> The `R Learning Resources for Genomics` repository is a curated collection of free resources to help the aspiring computational biologist learn about the `R` programming language. `R` is a free and open source language for statistical analyses and graphics. Biology and medicine generate more data than ever before. Data analysis skills and understanding of computational genomics is more important than ever.

<br>

### Getting Started with `R`

- [RStudio Education](https://education.rstudio.com/learn/) - RStudio provides free and open source tools for `R`, including educational tools.  Choose your `R` learning path: beginner, intermediate, expert.  Resources include cheat sheets, books and tutorials.
- [R for Data Science (R4DS)](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) - This book will teach you how to do data science with `R`. You’ll learn how to get your data into `R`, get it into the most useful structure, transform it, visualise it and model it.  It’s designed to take you from knowing nothing about `R` or the tidyverse to having all the basic tools of data science at your fingertips.
     - [R for Data Science: Exercise Solutions](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/) - This book contains the exercise solutions for the book `R for Data Science (R4DS)`, by Hadley Wickham and Garret Grolemund (Wickham and Grolemund 2017).
- [Data Flair](https://data-flair.training/blogs/r-tutorials-home/) - The tutorials are grouped by skill level (beginner, intermediate, expert).
- [Computational Genomics with R](https://compgenomr.github.io/book/index.html) - The aim of this online book is to provide the fundamentals for data analysis for genomics.  It contains practical and theoretical aspects of computational genomics.  Since computational genomics is interdisciplinary, this book aims to be accessible for biologists, medical scientists, computer scientists and people from other quantitative backgrounds.
- [R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/) - The goal of `R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis` is to teach novice programmers to write modular code and best practices for using `R` for data analysis.
- [R Programming Examples](https://www.datamentor.io/r-programming/examples/) - This web resource contains examples on basic concepts of `R` programming.

### Learn the Tidyverse
- [R for Data Science (R4DS)](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) - This book will teach you how to do data science with `R`. You’ll learn how to get your data into `R`, get it into the most useful structure, transform it, visualise it and model it.  It’s designed to take you from knowing nothing about `R` or the tidyverse to having all the basic tools of data science at your fingertips.
     - [R for Data Science: Exercise Solutions](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/) - This book contains the exercise solutions for the book `R for Data Science (R4DS)`, by Hadley Wickham and Garret Grolemund (Wickham and Grolemund 2017).
- [RStudio Cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) - `RStudio` cheatsheets make it easy to use some of our favorite `R` packages. New cheatsheets are added from time to time.
- [Statistical Inference via Data Science:  A ModernDive into R and the Tidyverse](https://moderndive.com/index.html) - “Help! I’m new to `R` and `RStudio` and I need to learn them! What do I do?” If you’re asking yourself this, this book is for you.
- [ggplot2: elegant graphics for data science](https://ggplot2-book.org/index.html) - This book by Hadley Wickham goes into greater depth into the ggplot2 visualisation system.  `ggplot2` is an `R` package for producing statistical, or data, graphics.


### What's next
- [What They Forgot to Teach You About R](https://rstats.wtf/) - Free online resource by Jenny Bryan and Jim Hester.  The material is based on in-person workshops that focused on building holistic and project-oriented workflows that address the most common sources of friction in data analysis, outside of doing the statistical analysis itself.
- [Advanced R (2nd Edition)](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/index.html) - This is the website for the 2nd edition of `Advanced R`, a book in Chapman & Hall’s R Series. The book is designed primarily for R users who want to improve their programming skills and understanding of the language. It should also be useful for programmers coming to R from other languages, as help you to understand why `R` works the way it does.

### Getting Help

### Genomics
- [Computational Genomics with R](https://compgenomr.github.io/book/index.html) - The aim of this online book is to provide the fundamentals for data analysis for genomics.  It contains practical and theoretical aspects of computational genomics.  Since computational genomics is interdisciplinary, this book aims to be accessible for biologists, medical scientists, computer scientists and people from other quantitative backgrounds.
- [Analysis of single cell RNA-seq data](https://www.singlecellcourse.org/index.html) - An online course (2021) that is taught through the University of Camgridge [Bioinformatics training unit](https://training.csx.cam.ac.uk/bioinformatics/).  This course discusses some of the questions that can be addressed using scRNA-seq as well as the available computational and statistical methods available. 
- [ANALYSIS OF SINGLE CELL RNA-SEQ DATA](https://broadinstitute.github.io/2019_scWorkshop/) - A course (2019) from the Broad Institute that is aimed at researchers and technical workers who are or will be analyzing single cell RNA-seq data.

### Continuous Learning
- [TidyTuesday - A weekly social data project in R](https://thomasmock.netlify.app/post/tidytuesday-a-weekly-social-data-project-in-r/) - A weekly social data project in `R`.  Every Monday they release a new dataset on the [TidyTuesday Github page](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) for participants to clean, wrangle, tidy, and plot.
- [Twitter for R programmers](https://www.t4rstats.com/index.html) - The R community is very active on Twitter. You can learn a lot about the language, about new approaches to problems, and make new friends.  This online book will show you how.

### Reproducibility

### R Markdown

### Git and Version Control
- [Excuse me, do you have a moment to talk about version control?](https://peerj.com/preprints/3159v2/) - This article by Jennifer Bryan describes the use of the version control system Git and and the hosting site GitHub for statistical and data scientific workflows. Special attention is given to projects that use the statistical language R and, optionally, R Markdown documents.
- [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/) - An online book that introduces Git, GitHub and version control.
