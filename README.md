> The `R Learning Resources for Genomics` repository is a curated collection of free resources to help the aspiring computational biologist learn about the `R` programming language. `R` is a free and open source language for statistical analyses and graphics. 

<br>

### Getting Started

- [RStudio Education](https://education.rstudio.com/learn/) - RStudio provides free and open source tools for `R`, including educational tools.  Choose your `R` learning path: beginner, intermediate, expert.  Resources include cheat sheets, books and tutorials.
- [Data Flair](https://data-flair.training/blogs/r-tutorials-home/) - The tutorials are grouped by skill level (beginner, intermediate, expert).
- [R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/) - The goal of `R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis` is to teach novice programmers to write modular code and best practices for using R for data analysis.
- [R Programming Examples](https://www.datamentor.io/r-programming/examples/) - This web resource contains examples on basic concepts of R programming.

### What's next
- [What They Forgot to Teach You About R](https://rstats.wtf/) - Free online resource by Jenny Bryan and Jim Hester.  The material is based on in-person workshops that focused on building holistic and project-oriented workflows that address the most common sources of friction in data analysis, outside of doing the statistical analysis itself.
