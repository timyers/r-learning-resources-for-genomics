> The `R Learning Resources for Genomics` repository is a curated collection of free resources to help the aspiring computational biologist learn about the `R` programming language. `R` is a free and open source language for statistical analyses and graphics. Biology and medicine generate an enormous amount data than ever before. Data analysis skills and understanding of computational genomics is more important than ever.

### Getting Started

- [RStudio Education](https://education.rstudio.com/learn/) - RStudio provides free and open source tools for `R`, including educational tools.  Choose your `R` learning path: beginner, intermediate, expert.  Resources include cheat sheets, books and tutorials.
- [Data Flair](https://data-flair.training/blogs/r-tutorials-home/) - The tutorials are grouped by skill level (beginner, intermediate, expert).
- [Computational Genomics with R](https://compgenomr.github.io/book/index.html) - The aim of this online book is to provide the fundamentals for data analysis for genomics.  It contains practical and theoretical aspects of computational genomics.  Since computational genomics is interdisciplinary, this book aims to be accessible for biologists, medical scientists, computer scientists and people from other quantitative backgrounds.
- [R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/) - The goal of `R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis` is to teach novice programmers to write modular code and best practices for using `R` for data analysis.
- [R Programming Examples](https://www.datamentor.io/r-programming/examples/) - This web resource contains examples on basic concepts of `R` programming.

### What's next
- [What They Forgot to Teach You About R](https://rstats.wtf/) - Free online resource by Jenny Bryan and Jim Hester.  The material is based on in-person workshops that focused on building holistic and project-oriented workflows that address the most common sources of friction in data analysis, outside of doing the statistical analysis itself.

### Git and Version Control
- [Excuse me, do you have a moment to talk about version control?](https://peerj.com/preprints/3159v2/) - This article by Jennifer Bryan describes the use of the version control system Git and and the hosting site GitHub for statistical and data scientific workflows. Special attention is given to projects that use the statistical language R and, optionally, R Markdown documents.
- [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/) - An online book that introduces Git, GitHub and version control.
